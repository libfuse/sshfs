# SSHFS


## About

SSHFS is part of the [libfuse](https://github.com/libfuse) project. 

SSHFS allows you to mount a remote filesystem using SFTP. Most SSH servers support and enable this
SFTP access by default, so SSHFS is very simple to use--there's nothing to do on the server-side.


## Development Status

SSHFS is shipped by all major Linux distributions and has been in production use across a wide range
of systems for many years. However, at present SSHFS does not have any active, regular contributors,
and there are a number of known issues (see all issues and bugs in the [SSHFS issue
tracker](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs/issues)). The current maintainer continues to apply pull
requests and makes regular releases, but unfortunately has no capacity to do any development beyond
addressing high-impact issues. _When reporting bugs, please understand that unless you are including
a pull request or are reporting a critical issue, you will probably not get a response._


## How to use

Once `sshfs` is installed (see the "[Build and Install](#build)" section below) running it is very
simple.

```bash
sshfs -h         # help menu
sshfs --version  # see version 
```

### 1. To mount a remote filesystem with `sshfs`:

General command syntax:
```bash
sshfs [user@]hostname_or_ip:[directory] mountpoint
```

For example, to connect to the username "john" on a host at local IP `10.0.0.1`, mounting the host's
root directory (`/`) in your local `~/mnt/sshfs` directory, you would do the following:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/mnt/sshfs  # create the ~/mnt/sshfs directory, if it doesn't already exist 
sshfs john@10.0.0.1:/ ~/mnt/sshfs
```

### 2. To unmount the remote filesystem:

General syntax:
```bash
# For most systems, including Ubuntu
fusermount -u mountpoint

# For BSD and MacOS, and also works fine on Ubuntu
umount mountpoint
```

For the example above:
```bash
# For most systems, including Ubuntu
fusermount -u ~/mnt/sshfs

# For BSD and MacOS, and also works fine on Ubuntu
umount ~/mnt/sshfs
```

### 3. Notes:
1. It is recommended to run SSHFS as a regular user (NOT as root). For this to work, the mount point
   must be owned by the user. Therefore, mounting into a `mount` or `mnt` directory you create 
   inside your home directory is a good practice.  
1. If the username (`user@` part of the command) is omitted, SSHFS will use the local username.
1. If the directory is omitted (while keeping the colon `:` just before it), SSHFS will mount the
   (remote) home directory.
1. If you need to enter a password, SSHFS will ask for it (actually, it just runs `ssh` which asks
   for the password if needed).

Also, many `ssh` options can be specified. See the manual pages for _sftp(1)_ (`man 1 sftp`) and
_ssh_config(5)_ (`man 5 ssh_config`). The remote port number (`-oport=PORT`) is one of the many
`ssh` options which works with `sshfs`.

## Build and Install

### 1. General overview

First, download the latest SSHFS release from https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs/releases. On Linux
and BSD (as opposed to MacOS), you will also need to install [libfuse][libfuse] 3.1.0 or newer. On
MacOS, you need [OSXFUSE][OSXFUSE] instead. Finally, you need the [Glib][Glib] library with
development headers, which should be available from your operating system's package manager.

To build and install, you must use [Meson][Meson] (version 0.38 or newer) and
[Ninja][Ninja]. After extracting the `sshfs` tarball, create a (temporary) build directory and run
Meson:

```bash
mkdir build; cd build
meson ..
```

Normally, the default build options will work fine. If you nevertheless want to adjust them, you can
do so with the `meson configure` command:

```bash
meson configure                # list options 
meson configure -D strip=true  # set an option
```

To build, test and install SSHFS, you then use Ninja. Running the tests requires the
[`py.test`][py.test] Python module. It also requires configuring ssh keys for passwordless  login to
yourself via _localhost_. See the [detailed notes about ssh key generation and setup](#sshkeygen)
below.

```bash
ninja
python3 -m pytest test/  # (Optional, but recommended) run the tests
sudo ninja install
```

### 2. Detailed instructions

_Tested 22 Dec. 2020 on Ubuntu 20.04._

1. Download and `cd` into the source code
    1. To download the latest source code:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs.git
        cd sshfs
        ```
    1. OR (recommended): To download the latest `sshfs` _release_:
        1. Find the release you want here: https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs/releases.
        1. Find the link to the `*.tar.gz` file you want. Example: https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs/archive/sshfs-3.7.1.tar.gz.
        1. Download, extract, and `cd` into it:
            ```bash
            wget https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs/archive/sshfs-3.7.1.tar.gz
            tar -xvzf sshfs-3.7.1.tar.gz
            cd sshfs-sshfs-3.7.1
            ```
1. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install meson cmake fuse3 libfuse3-dev libglib2.0-dev
    ```
1. Create a **build** dir, `cd` into it, run `meson`, and build and link with `ninja`:
    ```bash
    mkdir build 
    cd build 
    meson ..
    ninja  # this builds and produces the new `sshfs` executable
    ```

1. (Optional, but recommended) test your new `sshfs` executable. [This also includes detailed notes
   about ssh key generation and setup].
    1. Note: ssh key generation notes come [from GitHub here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
    ```bash
    # install the `pytest` python3 module in case you don't already have it
    pip3 install pytest  
    # install `sshd`
    sudo apt update 
    sudo apt install openssh-server

    # Configure passwordless ssh key-based login so you can ssh into yourself
    # (via `localhost`) for testing; see GitHub link above.
    # 1. Generate a new public-private key pair. 
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    # 2. Now add your new "~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub" public key to your 
    # "~/.ssh/authorized_keys" file so you can have key-based password-less
    # ssh sessions into yourself via `localhost` for testing.
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 

    # run the python3 tests in the "test" dir
    python3 -m pytest test/
    ```
    For [sample test output, see here](test/README.md).
1. Install `sshfs`:
    1. Normal method. This installs `sshfs` at `/usr/local/bin/sshfs`, whereas your normal Linux 
    distribution's executable is likely in `/usr/bin/sshfs`.
        ```bash
        # To install
        sudo ninja install
        ```
    1. Alternative method. This technique simply creates a symlink to the executable in your `~/bin` 
       dir so your Linux distro's install still remain's intact and untouched. (For Ubuntu).
        ```bash
        # "Install" via a symlink. Note: ensure you are in the same dir as the new `sshfs` 
        # executable first. 
        mkdir -p ~/bin
        ln -si "$(pwd)/sshfs ~/bin"
        . ~/.bashrc  # re-source your .bashrc file to bring the ~/bin dir into your PATH

        # To "Uninstall"
        rm ~/bin/sshfs
        ```
1. Check your version from another dir to ensure the installation worked correctly.
    ```bash
    cd ~
    sshfs --version
    ```
    Sample version output:
    ```
    SSHFS version 3.7.1
    FUSE library version 3.9.0
    using FUSE kernel interface version 7.31
    fusermount3 version: 3.9.0
    ```
